# Assembler and Emulator for a Simple Assembly Language

This project implements a custom two-pass assembler and an emulator (virtual CPU) for a toy assembly language with 18+ unique instructions, supporting branching, stack operations, and arithmetic.

---

## 🔧 Features

- ✅ Two-pass assembler with label resolution and symbol table generation
- ✅ Supports decimal, octal, and hexadecimal numbers
- ✅ Emits `.o` (binary), `.lst` (listing), and `.log` (errors/warnings)
- ✅ Emulator executes real instruction flow with branching, arithmetic, and stack support
- ✅ Read and write memory operations are traced and visualized
- ✅ Streamlit UI for uploading `.s` files and seeing assembled output, decoded instructions, and final memory/register state

---

## 🖥️ Usage

### Assemble a program
```bash
g++ assembler/assembler.cpp -o assembler
./assembler test_programs/example.s
Run the emulator
bash
Copy
Edit
g++ emulator/emulator.cpp -o emulator
./emulator example.o -run
./emulator example.o -dump       # memory dump
./emulator example.o -reg        # show registers
./emulator example.o -read       # show all memory reads
./emulator example.o -write      # show all memory writes
UI (optional)
bash
Copy
Edit
cd ui
streamlit run run_ui.py
